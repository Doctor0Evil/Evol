# Consent and Governance Surfaces

This document enumerates consent and governance touchpoints for Evol.

## Consent Surfaces

- Identity onboarding: Binding identities to consent scopes.
- Evolution manifests: Fine‑grained control over what can evolve and how.
- Session‑level overrides: Temporary tightening or relaxing of boundaries.

## Governance Surfaces

- Policy repositories: Versioned, auditable policy bundles.
- Governance tokens: Optional mechanisms for weighted decision‑making.
- Review boards: Human or agent committees that sign off on sensitive changes.

## Design Principles

- Explicitness: No implicit consent for evolution paths.
- Traceability: Every decision must be linkable to evidence and policy versions.
- Revocability: Identities can revoke or narrow consent while preserving history.
