# Cybernetic Feedback Loops in Evol

This document describes how Evol models cybernetic feedback loops between organic processes, sensors, the biophysical‑blockchain, and effectors.

## Core Loop

1. Sense: Organic or synthetic sensors emit state snapshots and events.
2. Encode: Adapters translate raw signals into Evol evolution events.
3. Decide: Nodes apply policies, manifests, and consensus to accept or reject events.
4. Act: Approved evolution steps drive effectors or higher‑order processes.
5. Learn: New state feeds back into policy updates, manifests, and model refinement.

## Loop Layers

- First‑order loop: Direct sensor → policy → effector cycles for reflex‑like responses.
- Second‑order loop: Meta‑controllers adjust policies, thresholds, and manifests over time.
- Social loop: Communities, tokens, and governance contracts modulate acceptable evolution paths.

## Safety Anchors

- All loops pass through consent‑aware manifests.
- Every accepted action is linked to evidence and policy identifiers.
- Failed or risky transitions are logged, observable, and auditable.
