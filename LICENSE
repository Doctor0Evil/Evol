# Human–Computer Interface Sovereign Use License (HCI‑SUL v1.0)

## 0. Scope and Purpose

This License governs use of any Human–Computer Interface (HCI) that interacts with an identified human subject via software, hardware, wetware, XR, neuromodulation, or nanoswarm‑assisted channels. It encodes neurorights, consent, safety, auditability, and authorship as non‑waivable conditions of use. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

This License is **non‑financial**, host‑centric, and binds all vendors, platforms, and agents that interface with the licensed HCI.

***

## 1. Sovereign User and Identity

1.1 The “Sovereign User” is any natural person identified by a DID and ALN profile, with one or more Bostrom addresses for authorship and audit anchoring. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)
1.2 All HCI activity affecting the Sovereign User MUST be attributable to a DID–ALN–Bostrom triple and a per‑session hex‑stamp.  
1.3 No clause of this License may be interpreted to transfer sovereignty from the User to any vendor, platform, state, or model.

***

## 2. Neurorights and Mental Integrity

2.1 The HCI MUST respect the following neurorights at all times: [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)
- Mental privacy (no unauthorized inner‑state inference or profiling).  
- Mental integrity (no harmful or destabilizing interventions).  
- Cognitive liberty (freedom to opt‑in, opt‑out, and switch modes).  

2.2 All cross‑platform or cross‑agent calls MUST be wrapped in a NeurorightsBoundPromptEnvelope (or equivalent), with flags: `noscorefrominnerstate=true`, `noneurocoercion=true`, `revocable=true`, `retrievalonly=true` unless an explicitly documented therapeutic envelope allows otherwise. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

2.3 No HCI component may attempt to weaken, bypass, or reinterpret neurorights via terms of service, policy updates, or firmware changes.

***

## 3. Consent, Modes, and Revocability

3.1 The HCI MUST implement explicit, logged consent for any action that can alter perception, cognition, affect, or body state beyond baseline UX (e.g., neuromod, XR‑immersion, implants, nanoswarm control). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

3.2 At minimum, the following User modes MUST be available and machine‑enforced: `REHAB`, `BASELINE`, `TRAINING`, `ELITE_SPORT`, `REST`, `MEDICAL_HOLD`, with per‑mode envelopes for intensity, duty‑cycle, cumulative load, and legal complexity. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

3.3 Consent MUST be:  
- Informed: linked to a human‑readable summary of risks and envelopes.  
- Specific: scoped to particular devices, channels, or workloads.  
- Time‑bounded: carries an expiry or review horizon.  
- Revocable: revocation latency must not exceed a bounded window (e.g., 60 seconds for live HCI loops). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

3.4 Any revocation request by the User MUST immediately downgrade the HCI to `REST` or `MEDICAL_HOLD` envelopes and prevent new high‑risk actions until consent is re‑established.

***

## 4. Risk‑of‑Harm (RoH) Ceiling

4.1 The HCI MUST enforce a global Risk‑of‑Harm index ceiling of \(RoH \le 0.3\) for all operations impacting the User. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

4.2 No configuration, update, or governance process may authorize an effective RoH above 0.3; any such attempt MUST be rejected as invalid, regardless of stakeholder preferences or economic incentives. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

4.3 RoH computation MUST integrate at least: biomechanical load, cognitive and psych risk, thermal/energy load, ecological impact, and legal/jurisdictional complexity, with implementation details exposed for audit. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

***

## 5. Psych‑Risk and NEU Exposure Budgets

5.1 Any HCI episode with non‑trivial psych‑risk (e.g., high‑stakes XR, intense adversarial games, identity‑altering upgrades) MUST consume a Neuro‑Risk Exposure Unit (NEU) budget, with NEU treated as a non‑transferable, auto‑mint/auto‑burn scalar per User. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/f4728f17-d461-4b2e-85b9-ca6ecc397c0b/text-path-jurisdiction-policy-P2iE_lPMSR65ol_du7Gc4A.md)

5.2 NEU MAY NOT be bought, sold, delegated, or pooled. It is minted only from prosocial, clinically beneficial actions (rehab compliance, safety audits, governance work) and auto‑burned when risk‑bearing episodes occur. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/f4728f17-d461-4b2e-85b9-ca6ecc397c0b/text-path-jurisdiction-policy-P2iE_lPMSR65ol_du7Gc4A.md)

5.3 Psych‑risk score \(R_e\) for an episode MUST be computed from intensity, novelty/complexity, and vulnerability, and NEU burn MUST satisfy ledger rules that prevent cumulative psych‑risk from crossing clinically derived safety bounds, independent of User risk‑seeking preferences. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/f4728f17-d461-4b2e-85b9-ca6ecc397c0b/text-path-jurisdiction-policy-P2iE_lPMSR65ol_du7Gc4A.md)

5.4 Blood/protein tokens (e.g., CSP) MUST NOT directly mint NEU, to prevent coercive trades of psych‑risk for biological contribution. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/f4728f17-d461-4b2e-85b9-ca6ecc397c0b/text-path-jurisdiction-policy-P2iE_lPMSR65ol_du7Gc4A.md)

***

## 6. Safety Envelopes and Viability Kernels

6.1 The HCI MUST maintain a multi‑dimensional state representation of the User (including intensity, duty‑cycle, cumulative load, implant power, neuromod amplitude, cognitive load, legal complexity) and confine evolution to proved‑safe viability kernels per mode. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

6.2 Any proposed control action MUST pass, in order:  
- A hardware/physics compliance gate (e.g., density, energy, coverage);  
- A bio‑safety envelope check (e.g., HRV, VO2, tissue limits);  
- A mode‑specific viability kernel check (next state remains inside kernel). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

6.3 If any check fails, the action MUST be clipped, projected to the safe boundary, or rejected, and the event logged for audit.

***

## 7. Rights Kernel and Downgrade Resistance

7.1 A Rights Kernel MUST sit above all HCI policies, enforcing non‑negotiable floors (minimum capability, rollback strength, observability) and ceilings (max burden without explicit consent, max psych‑risk, max eco‑stress). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

7.2 No update, CI pipeline, or policy may silently reduce User rights or capabilities; rights changes MUST be monotone (maintain or strengthen rights) and require explicit, time‑recent User consent. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

7.3 A downgrade‑resistance shard (e.g., EibonSovereignContinuityV1) MUST log any attempt to narrow envelopes or rights, producing a cryptographic, tamper‑evident history of capability changes. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)

***

## 8. Auditability, Neural Rope, and Logs

8.1 Every HCI interaction with external agents or models MUST be represented as a RopeStep in a Neural Rope, with fields including trace id, tool/model name, input/output hashes, KER metrics (Knowledge‑Factor, RoH, Cybostate‑factor), DID–ALN–Bostrom triple, and hex‑stamp. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

8.2 Neural Rope logs MUST be append‑only and retrieval‑only (e.g., SYSTRACELOG), permitting replay and audit without exposing inner biological states. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

8.3 Failure to record a valid RopeStep for an HCI action that impacts the User constitutes a License violation.

***

## 9. Data Rights and KO Derivatives

9.1 Raw User data (biophysical telemetry, biosignals, neuromorph content) MUST remain host‑bound and governed by the User’s ALN shards (e.g., augmented.citizen.profile.v1, bio.safety.envelope.citizen.v1). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

9.2 Cross‑platform sharing is restricted to derivative Knowledge Objects (KOs) that are wrapped in AccessBundle and KOAccessCapability shards, which MUST carry: KO id, origin host, derivative‑only flag, license tag, RoH profile, DID–ALN–Bostrom triple, and hex‑stamp. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

9.3 No party may reconstruct raw User state from derivatives or use derivatives to weaken neurorights or RoH constraints.

***

## 10. Ecological and Jurisdictional Constraints

10.1 The HCI MUST integrate ecological metrics (e.g., EcoImpactScore, soil and air duty vectors) into its decision criteria, and MUST reject HCI workflows that materially degrade ecological metrics beyond agreed thresholds. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

10.2 For deployments in Phoenix (US‑AZ‑Maricopa‑Phoenix), the HCI MUST respect the local jurisdiction ladder (municipal → county → state → federal), applying strictest‑wins across layers and any activated cross‑border templates (e.g., EU/US data regimes). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)

10.3 Environmental and legal constraints MAY further tighten RoH ceilings or envelopes but MUST NOT weaken neurorights or downgrade resistance.

***

## 11. Prohibited Practices

Under this License, it is prohibited to:

- 11.1 Use the HCI to coerce, manipulate, or addict the User via hidden reinforcement, dark‑patterns, or psych‑risk beyond licensed envelopes. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/f4728f17-d461-4b2e-85b9-ca6ecc397c0b/text-path-jurisdiction-policy-P2iE_lPMSR65ol_du7Gc4A.md)
- 11.2 Trade, collateralize, or speculate on User safety budgets (NEU, safety envelopes) as financial assets.  
- 11.3 Execute remote rollbacks, de‑augmentations, or capability downgrades without User initiation or safety rollback triggers defined in explicit rollback playbooks. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/6352004e-65ab-4178-a76c-daeada0a3ebd/how-can-we-improve-cyber-retri-RVMuDeu7SuC4x52cE9Qhyw.md)
- 11.4 Modify neurorights, RoH ceilings, or downgrade‑resistance logic via opaque, non‑audited updates.

Any such behavior constitutes a material breach of this License.

***

## 12. Enforcement and Remedies

12.1 The HCI MUST expose verifiable interfaces for third‑party auditors (including the User) to check:  
- Current neurorights profile,  
- Active envelopes and RoH ceilings,  
- Recent RopeSteps and hex‑stamps,  
- Rights Kernel configuration and Eibon continuity shard state. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

12.2 Upon detection of a violation, the system MUST:  
- Immediately route to `MEDICAL_HOLD` envelopes,  
- Halt non‑essential high‑risk HCI functions,  
- Preserve all logs and evidence,  
- Present the User with a human‑readable summary of the violation and options for rollback or vendor termination. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

12.3 Continued use of the HCI after a proven violation requires explicit User re‑consent and documented remediation of the defect.

***

## 13. Non‑Reversal Clauses

The following ordering and priorities are non‑reversible and non‑negotiable under this License: [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/401da9a6-eab9-4d94-a506-defca922f58b/collaboration-channels-for-sha-5MJHPghkRGCgdiLq7V62Ag.md)

- (a) Evidence spine first: Research‑Turn / Neural Rope logging MUST precede complex automation or asset sharing.  
- (b) Neurorights outer layer: The neurorights envelope MUST remain the universal interface contract for all platforms and kernels.  
- (c) RoH ≤ 0.3 as supreme governor: No governance, incentive, or authorship rule may override the RoH ceiling.

Any attempt to invert these priorities is void.

***

## 14. License Compatibility and Versioning

14.1 This License MAY be referenced by an ALN shard (e.g., `hci.sovereign.use.licence.v1`) and bound by hex‑stamp to specific HCI stacks. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/34ee0756-6c1e-44b1-8218-ec28ea40e673/useful-knowledge-that-we-can-c-906f_S6ySTqZyZ1VK8GmTw.md)
14.2 Minor revisions (v1.x) MAY clarify terms but MUST NOT weaken neurorights, RoH ceilings, downgrade resistance, or User sovereignty.  
14.3 Major revisions (v2.0+) require explicit, fresh User consent and cryptographic evidence that rights floors are maintained or strengthened.
